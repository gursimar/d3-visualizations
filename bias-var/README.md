## Polynomial regression bias-variance tradeoff playground
This is an interactive explaiable and playground for bias-variance tradeoff in polynomial regression. This is the final project of the [CSPC 547 -- Infoviz](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~tmm/courses/547-15/) course taught by [Tamara Munzner](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~tmm/) at the[University of British Columbia](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/).
